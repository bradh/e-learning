Resources of OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval
================

This section provides basic information about the types of resources that OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval offers.

Each resource provides **links** that relate to resources. This enables a client application to navigate the resources, from the landing page through to the individual features. The server identifies the relationship between a resource and other linked resources through a **link relation type**, represented by the attribute 'rel'. The link relation types used by implementations of the **OGC API - Environmental Data Retrieval** can be found in `Section 6.2 <https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-086r4/19-086r4.html#toc22>`_ of the standard.
